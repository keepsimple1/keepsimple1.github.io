    <h1>SwiftUI: pitfalls when using NavigationView with TabView</h1>
    <p>2024-02-02</p>

    <h2>Problem</h2>
    I have a SwiftUI app that has the following view hierarchy:

    <p>
        <code>
            WindowGroup -> NavigationView -> TabView -> ContentView -> NavigationLink(DetailView)
        </code>
    </p>

    Inside <code>DetailView</code>, there is a button that triggers <code>ActionSheet</code>:

    <p>
        <code>Button() {}.ActionSheet()</code>
    </p>

    The issue is that when the <code>ActionSheet</code> is dismissed, its superview i.e. <code>DetailView</code> is also
    dismissed, i.e. popped from the navigation stack back to <code>ContentView</code>.
    <p>
        What I wanted is that when <code>ActionSheet</code> is dismissed, the app should stay at
        <code>DetailView</code>.
    </p>

    <h2>Root cause</h2>

    Upon lots of debugging, it seems that the reason is: when <code>NavigationView</code> wraps <code>TabView</code>,
    this will happen. I cannot find why SwiftUI does this though.

    <h2>Solution and its pitfalls</h2>

    A simple solution is to move <code>NavigationView</code> inside <code>TabView</code>, and wraps
    <code>ContentView</code>. I.e. the root of the navigation stack will be <code>ContentView</code>, not
    <code>TabView</code>:
    <p>
        <code>
            WindowGroup -> TabView -> NavigationView -> ContentView -> NavigationLink(DetailView)
        </code>
    </p>

    This kind of makes sense because the user really navigates back to <code>ContentView</code>. Now when
    <code>ActionSheet</code> is dismissed, the <code>DetailView</code> stays on the screen and not to be popped up from
    the navigation stack.

    <h3>pitfalls</h3>

    However, this solution is not perfect. Now the whole navigation stack is inside the <code>TabView</code>, all views
    pushed on the stack will have <code>TabBar</code> showing at the bottom. This is a problem as we do not want to show
    the <code>TabBar</code> when we are in <code>DetailView</code>.

    <p>
        It turns out that it is not easy to hide the <code>TabBar</code> before iOS 16. In iOS 16, you can do
        <code>.toolbar(.hide, for: TabBar)</code>. But in iOS 15 or earlier, this modifier is not available and we have
        to be creative.
    </p>

    <h3>Solution to hide TabBar in iOS 15</h3>

    Finally I found the following solution on StackOverflow for iOS 15 or earlier that works with a minor issue. The
    minor issue is that
    when the <code>TabBar</code> shows again, it takes a bit time, like 0.5 second, which is noticable. But I think it
    is OK given this solution is simpler than many other alternatives. Here is the gist of the code:

    <pre>
        // To solve the problem of hiding TabBar in a child view in NavigationView:
        // https://stackoverflow.com/a/75457588/1783732
        // Note: this is only needed for iOS 15 or earlier.
        extension UIView {
            func allSubviews() -> [UIView] {
                var allSubviews = subviews
                for subview in subviews {
                    allSubviews.append(contentsOf: subview.allSubviews())
                }
                return allSubviews
            }
        }
        
        extension UITabBar {
            private static var originalY: Double?
        
            static public func changeTabBarState(shouldHide: Bool) {
                let windowScene = UIApplication.shared.connectedScenes.first as? UIWindowScene
                windowScene?.windows.first(where: { $0.isKeyWindow })?.allSubviews().forEach({ view in
                    if let tabBar = view as? UITabBar {
                        if !tabBar.isHidden && shouldHide {
                            originalY = (tabBar.superview?.frame.origin.y)!
                            tabBar.superview?.frame.origin.y = (tabBar.superview?.frame.origin.y)! + 4.5
                        } else if tabBar.isHidden && !shouldHide {
                            guard let originalY else {
                                return
                            }
                            tabBar.superview?.frame.origin.y = originalY
                        }
                        tabBar.isHidden = shouldHide
                        tabBar.superview?.setNeedsLayout()
                        tabBar.superview?.layoutIfNeeded()
                    }
                })
            }
        }        
    </pre>

    To use this code, we just need to add such modifier to <code>DetailView</code>:

    <pre>
        .onAppear {
            UITabBar.changeTabBarState(shouldHide: true)
        }
        .onDisappear {
            UITabBar.changeTabBarState(shouldHide: false)
        }
    </pre>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    In SwiftUI, avoid wrapping <code>TabView</code> in a <code>NavigationView</code>. It is better to put
    <code>NavigationView</code> inside <code>TabView</code>, and if
    you want to hide the TabBar, there are different methods for iOS 16 and iOS 15.

    <pre>
        iOS version: 15.0
        XCode version:  14.2
    </pre>
