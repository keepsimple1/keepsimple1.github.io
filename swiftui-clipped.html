    <h1>SwiftUI: how ".clipped" saved my navigation</h1>

        Problem
    </h2>
    <p>
        In one of my SwiftUI apps, I have a <code>NavigationLink</code> with its destination view like this:
    <p></p>
    <pre>
            GeometryReader { geo in
                HStack(spacing: itemSpacing) {
                    ...
                } 
                .offset(scrollOffset)
            }   
        </pre>

    The HStack supports scrolling because it has 3 items and only 1 item is on screen for any given time.

    <p></p>
    A problem happens when the user clicks the "Back" button to pop this destination view and navigate back
    to the parent view: The 1st item in the HStack would show up on screen for a short time before disappearing.
    It is a very annoying visual bug.

    <h2>Root cause</h2>

    After careful observations, I noticed that what happens is:
    <p></p>
    when the user clicks the Navigation Back button, SwiftUI pops up the child view by sliding it
    off the screen using its default animation. But because the "HStack" is wider than the screen, the current
    item (i.e. 2nd item) would slide off the screen first, and then the 1st item (was invisible) would slide
    into the screen before out of the screen. That's why the 1st item suddenly shows up for a short time.

    <h2>The fix</h2>
    After identifying the root cause, I realized that the best / simplest fix is to make sure "HStack" would
    always limit its content to the current item (i.e. things on screen). I tried to use `.frame()` modifier
    first but the result is random at best. Then I encountered the `.clipped()` modifier and it turns out That
    is exactly what I wanted. After the fix, it looks like this:

    <pre>
        GeometryReader { geo in
            HStack(spacing: itemSpacing) {
                ...
            } 
            .offset(scrollOffset)
            .clipped()
        }   
    </pre>

        Problem solved !!!
